# AI-Based Behavioral Clustering of Instagram Users
This repository contains the project, titled “AI-Based Behavioral Clustering of Instagram Users,” aims to classify Instagram users into meaningful categories—such as addicted, casual, and unbothered—based on their interaction patterns.

🔍 Project Overview
Social media usage patterns offer deep insights into user behavior. This project uses K-Means clustering to group Instagram users based on two main features:

Instagram Visit Score (engagement frequency)

Spending Rank (relative spending behavior on the platform)

The result is a segmentation model that helps stakeholders better understand and respond to user behavior for platform design, personalized marketing, and digital wellbeing.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Tools and Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

Dataset source: Kaggle (simulated data for academic use)


📊 Clustering Results
After data preprocessing and model evaluation, the following user segments were identified:

Cluster	Visit Score	Spending Rank	Interpretation
0	High	High	Addicted Users
1	Low	Low	Unbothered Users
3	Low	High	Occasional Spenders
4	High	Low	Casual Users
    

This project is for educational and academic purposes only.
